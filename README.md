Meal Connect: Fight Food Waste, Nourish Your Community
Meal Connect is a free app that bridges the gap between those with surplus food and individuals facing hunger in your community. It's a simple way to fight food waste and make a positive impact.

Here's how it works:
Donors: Do you have leftover groceries, prepared meals, or restaurant portions that are still good but won't get eaten? List them on Meal Connect with a photo and description.
A request will be generated for you which will be taken care by the delivery drivers to donate the food to the needy ones by giving you a status of where your order is!
